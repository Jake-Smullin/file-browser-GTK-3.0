# file-browser-GTK-3.0
Spent a couple of weeks implementing a simple file browser GUI using C and GTK+3.0. Contains a file system view pane, and a directory view pane, and finallly a hexview pane for the selected file.

Note- For copyright issues and also academic honesty I can't share with you my source code, please feel free to contact me.
